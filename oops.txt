OOps in c++ is introduced to solve the problem by organizing code into classes and object making program easier to understand we use & maintain 

Key features in C++
Structures code into logicak unit(Classes and OBJ)
Keeps releted data and method together(encapsulation)
Makes code Moduar ,reuseable & scaleable
Prevent Unauthorised access to data

CHARECTERISTICS OF OOPS
1 Class
2 Obj
3 Incabulation
4 Extraction 
5 INtrance
6 POlymolters

Classs -is a Prototype or blue print from which Obj are created ,Its the set of Data members or Methods That are to all OBJ
OBJ -IT is an Basic unit of oops THAT represent An object,state ,meber function ,Bheviour and identity
Abstraction- TIt is the process hiding of Implementation Details Only showing the Assential details and features to the user
Incapsullation- It is a process of Rarring data and Method into a single unit 
It can be achived by all the variables in a class as a private & publc mtd
In the Class set And the values of Variables
Interance- It is an important pillar of oops where 1 class is allow to inheritate features (Data members,Member Function) of a class
We achieve Inheritance by Using the access specifier (pub,pvt ,protected)And is also known as Asd relationship 

Imp term of inheritance
Superclass
subclass
re-usability

Polymoltrs- It means many forms 
It allows the same mtd to behave diffrently
