    <h1>GENZ PROTESTING IN NEPAL</h1>
    
    <h3>In September 2025 Nepal descended into political crisis after the government imposed a sweeping social media ban in an apparent attempt to silence dissent. The move, against a backdrop of economic dysfunction and widespread youth disillusionment, ignited mass protests across Kathmandu and other Nepalese cities, led largely by Generation Z demonstrators. Clashes between protesters and security forces broke out on September 8; by September 9 the parliament building and other government offices were in flames and Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli had resigned. The ban was lifted that day, but protests continued until the army imposed a nationwide curfew on September 10. As of September 14 the violence had left 72 dead and more than 2,113 injured. The crisis echoed recent youth-led uprisings in Sri Lanka (2022) and Bangladesh (2024), underscoring the fragility of small South Asian democracies and raising far-reaching questions about the future of free speech and digital expression in Asia.

In an ironic turn of events, the very medium the government had tried to suppress—social media—became the primary forum for debating the country’s future. More than 145,000 citizens joined a Discord server that reporters dubbed a new “national convention,” with participants describing the platform as effectively replacing parliament. By September 10 the group had rallied around Sushila Karki, Nepal’s first female chief justice, as their choice for interim prime minister. After consultations with the army, the decision was relayed to the president’s office, and Karki was sworn in on September 12 as the country’s first woman leader. On September 15 Karki unveiled her first cabinet, appointing several figures with reformist credentials, a move widely interpreted as a signal of her commitment to transparency and rebuilding public trust. Still, questions of legitimacy lingered: while some hailed the Gen Z uprising as a triumph over corruption and oligarchy, others warned that the burning of parliament and the Discord-based “election” were extralegal at best and could undermine the new government’s stability.
